<img src = "background.png"></img>
#### Theme : STRESS REDUCTION

### Introduction

This Application recommends songs from Spotify of a particular genre based on the real time emotions of the user i.e by capturing and detecting stress using WebCam.

### What problems does it solve?

We often find it hard to discuss our feelings with others.
In this project, we have created a live emotion detection algorithm that can predict the emotions of the person in real time and recommend songs to make them **FEEL** better.

### Python Libraries
- App deployed using Streamlit Python Library
- Casscade Classifiers and Webcam input from OpenCV
- A Lightweight Face Recognition and Facial Attribute Analysis Framework Deepface for Emotion Recognition
- Spotify API to fetch songs and playlists based on emotions


### How to Run the application:
Make sure you have all the dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt and run the command `streamlit run app.py` in terminal
